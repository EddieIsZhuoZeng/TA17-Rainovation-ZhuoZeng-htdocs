** Version numbering scheme **

Basic Google Maps Placemarks x.y.z
x = Major, fundamental changes, possibly breaking backwards compatability. Will probably never do a 2.0 unless WP makes some fundamental change to custom post types, Google releases v4 of the API, or you gradually refactor large portions of the plugin to use better OO/MVC patterns
y = New features or other significant changes. Things that average users would want enough to upgrade.
z = Bug fixes, minor tweaks, small feature additions
